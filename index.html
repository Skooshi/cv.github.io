                <p>During my internship, I actively contributed to various graphic design and architectural projects,
                    gaining hands-on experience with industry-standard tools and techniques. I worked on conceptualizing
                    visual layouts, creating digital mockups, and assisting in the design process for marketing
                    materials and architectural presentations. Additionally, I collaborated with professionals to
                    understand spatial planning, 3D modeling, and structural design principles, which enhanced my
                    ability to merge creativity with technical precision.</p>

                <p><strong>Öncan Veterinary Clinic - Cyprus, Girne</strong></p>
                <p>Internship Duration: 1 month</p>
                <p>As a full-time volunteer, I was responsible for the daily care of animals, including feeding,
                    grooming, and monitoring their health. I assisted veterinarians with basic medical procedures and
                    helped maintain a clean and organized environment. This experience strengthened my ability to work
                    under pressure, improved my time management skills, and taught me the importance of discipline,
                    efficiency, and attention to detail in a professional setting.</p>
                <p><strong>Kyrenia Special Education Center</strong></p>
                <p>Internship Duration: 1 month</p>
                <p>At Kyrenia Special Education Center, I assisted in providing support to children with special
                    needs,
                    helping them with daily activities, educational tasks, and creative exercises. I worked closely with
                    educators to create an inclusive and supportive environment, fostering social and cognitive
                    development. This experience strengthened my patience, communication skills, and ability to adapt to
                    different learning needs while deepening my empathy and understanding of special education
                    practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Zero Food Waste Cyprus</strong></p>
                <p>Volunteer Duration: 2 months</p>
                <p>At Zero Food Waste Cyprus, I participated in initiatives aimed at reducing food waste and promoting
                    sustainability. My responsibilities included collecting surplus food from local businesses,
                    organizing distribution to those in need, and raising awareness through community outreach programs.
                    This experience enhanced my teamwork skills, deepened my understanding of food sustainability
                    challenges, and reinforced my commitment to social and environmental responsibility.</p>

                <h2>Passion</h2>
                <p>From a young age, I have been deeply passionate about design and technology. The ability to create
                    visually compelling and functional designs has always fascinated me, pushing me to explore various
                    artistic and digital mediums. Whether working on graphic design, architectural concepts, or
                    programming, I find immense satisfaction in bringing ideas to life. My passion for continuous
                    learning and innovation drives me to experiment with new techniques, tools, and creative approaches.
                    I believe that design is not just about aesthetics but about solving problems and enhancing user
                    experiences.

                    In the past, when I had more free time, I was also very active in sports. Engaging in physical
                    activities not only helped me develop discipline and teamwork but also strengthened my ability to
                    focus and stay determined—skills that I now apply to my professional and creative projects.</p>


                <h2>Project and Future Aspirations</h2>
                <p>My goal is to merge my expertise in design, architecture, and technology to create impactful and
                    innovative projects. I aspire to work on large-scale digital experiences, from branding and user
                    interfaces to interactive designs that push creative boundaries. In the future, I aim to specialize
                    in UI/UX design and digital product development, ensuring that my work not only looks visually
                    appealing but also enhances usability and functionality.

                    Additionally, I plan to further my education in design and technology, gaining more expertise in 3D
                    modeling, artificial intelligence-driven design, and sustainable architecture. Ultimately, I hope to
                    contribute to projects that make a meaningful difference in people's lives, blending creativity with
                    technological advancements.</p>
